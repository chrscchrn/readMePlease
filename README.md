### Usage
    Answer the prompts with the formal information you would put into your own README. Add a screenshot or two and a link to the hosted website if needed.

### License

### Test
    None

### Screenshots
    [This](screenshot.png) is what it looks like on Visual Studio Code.

### Link to Website
    *this is for repositories that need a link to the actual website.       

The above is essentially what the this REAME generator will produce. The user should expect to install Inquirer and Node.JS before use. Type in node index.js to run the program. A series of questions can be formally answered and then they will be organized and formatted for them.
